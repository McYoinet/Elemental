## About

Elemental aims to be a fully customizable, general purpose Paper plugin with basic functionalities divided into modules that can be enabled and disabled at the discretion of the server owner. It uses [MiniMessage's format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) to style the messages, and supports every placeholder from PlaceholderAPI. Please check out the [Wiki page](https://github.com/McYoinet/Elemental/wiki) for an in-depth and detailed explanation of every feature Elemental has to offer and how to customize it.

## Download

You can find the latest version of the plugin in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/McYoinet/Elemental/releases) page. It is also published through [Polymart](https://polymart.org/) and [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/).

## This is a Paper plugin

This plugin makes use of some **Paper's** API exclusive methods, and its internal implementation of MiniMessage to style the messages. Because of this, Elemental will only run on Paper-based servers (Paper, Purpur, Pufferfish), but not on CraftBukkit or Spigot servers.

## Compiling

You can compile the plugin using the command `gradle build --info`, the plugin will be on the `/jar/build/libs/` directory of your project root. Please use Java 21 to compile it.
